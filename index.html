<h1>LCD Soundsystem!! <em>The band</em></h1>


<p>
<h3>My <em>love</em> for LCD Soundsystem!</h3>
LCD Soundsystem is the best band in the whole world!
The first time I saw LCD Soundsystem was in Mexico City at Hipodromo de las Americas.
The second time I saw them was in Coachella in 2010 and the third time was last night at the Aragon Balroom in Chicago.
