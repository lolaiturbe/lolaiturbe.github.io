<h1>LCD Soundsystem!! <em>The band</em></h1>


<p>LCD Soundsystem is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2002. The band is fronted by musician James Murphy.
The band began by recording and releasing multiple singles from 2002 to 2004 leading up to their eponymous debut studio album, which was released in 2005.
It received a Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Their single "Daft Punk Is Playing at My House", is their most successful single.
In 2007, the band released their second studio album, Sound of Silver, and was nominated the Grammys for Best Electronic/Dance Album.
Three years later, LCD Soundsystem released their third studio album, <em>This Is Happening</em>, which became their first top-ten album in the United States.
In February 2011, the band anounced they were separating. After their large farewell concert at Madison Square Garden on April 2, 2011.
After a series of rumors hinting at a possible band reunion, LCD Soundsystem released the single "Christmas Will Break Your Heart" in December 2015, making it their first single in five years.
LCD Soundsystem later confirmed their reunion and announced an expanded tour, including appearances at several high-profile music festivals, as well as a new studio album.
American Dream was released in September 2017 and has been touring since.

<h1>My <em>love</em> for LCD Soundsystem!</h1>

The first time I saw LCD Soundsystem was in Mexico City at Hipodromo de las Americas.
And the second was last night at the Aragon Balroom in Chicago.
